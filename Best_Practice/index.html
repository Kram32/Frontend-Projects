        <p>I am one of the aspiring software engineers at Avion School.
        As a student of Avion School, I want to become a successful software engineer with the help of my
        classmates and my instructors. I chose this kind of practice in terms of programming because you can
        identify your code properly at the same time you can fix your code immediately. You dont need to make
        your program or code be complicated. </p>
